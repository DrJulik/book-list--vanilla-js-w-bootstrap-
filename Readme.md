# The Book Tracker App

## What is this project?

This is a classic Vanilla JS project "The Book List App". However, this one has many features added on top of the regular "add book and delete book".

## Features of this book list:

You can search the list by title, author or isbn. You can press on the headers in the list to order them alphabetically or numerically.
Upon the addition of the book, the app generates a link to the Goodreads page of that book (provided you have entered correct ISBN).
The App also features an autocomplete feature, which takes items from a JSON file and displays them using `<datalist>` (This feature is here to simulate how an app would behave if it had a cool database with all the books).

### Me

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask!
